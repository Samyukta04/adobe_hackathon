# PDF Language Extractor â€“ Adobe Hackathon Round 1B

This tool processes a collection of PDFs and identifies the most relevant content based on a user **persona** and **job-to-be-done**. It uses **local language models** (via Ollama) and intelligent fallback strategies when models are unavailable.

---

## What the Code Does

This project consists of several key stages:

### 1. Input Parsing
- Reads the `challenge1b_input.json` file.
- Extracts the **persona** and **job-to-be-done** fields and combines them to form a **query**.

### 2. PDF Processing
- Opens each PDF file in the `PDFs/` directory using `PyMuPDF (fitz)`.
- For each page, extracts:
  - **Headings** (based on font size, formatting, etc.)
  - **Content** (full paragraph text below or around headings)

### 3. Embedding Text
- Attempts to use **Ollama** models to embed each section.
- If models are unavailable, it uses a **custom fallback embedding function** based on word frequencies, keywords, punctuation, and structure.

### 4. Section Ranking
- All section embeddings are compared with the query embedding using cosine similarity.
- A **diversity penalty** is applied to avoid ranking too many sections from the same document.
- Top `N` relevant sections are selected.

### 5. Summarization
- Uses **spaCy** to break down selected sections into readable summaries (first few important sentences).

### 6. Output Generation
- Writes results to a `challenge1b_output.json` file.
- Output contains:
  - Metadata
  - Top-ranked sections
  - Summaries of each relevant section

## Folder Structure

Each collection folder should look like this:

```

CollectionName/
â”œâ”€â”€ challenge1b\_input.json
â”œâ”€â”€ challenge1b\_output.json  # (created after run)
â”œâ”€â”€ PDFs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file1.pdf
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file2.pdf
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...

````

### Example `challenge1b_input.json`
```json
{
  "persona": {
    "role": "Travel Planner"
  },
  "job_to_be_done": {
    "description": "Plan a trip of 4 days for a group of 10 college friends."
  }
}
````

---

## How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pymupdf spacy numpy ollama
```

Make sure you also download the Spacy English model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Step 2: Run the Processor

```bash
python process_collection.py
```

It automatically looks for all folders in the current directory with "Collection" in the name.

## ðŸ”§ Supported Embedding Models (Ollama)

The system tries these models in order:

1. `nomic-embed-text`
2. `all-minilm`
3. `mxbai-embed-large`
4. `snowflake-arctic-embed`
5. `bge-large`
